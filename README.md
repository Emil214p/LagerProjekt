<h1>Emil215ps attempt at a site.</h1>
<p>This is a site im developing that can work as a store.</p>
<p>The site is basic, it allows you to make a store like site, you can add items, you can log in, you can "buy" stuff.</p>
<p>The needed database along with some sample data is included in the file mysql.sql and can be imported to MySQL.</p>
<p>You need to modify IConnectInfo.php and UniversalConnect.php to work with your MySQL database, as the login info and url is incorrect by default.</p>
